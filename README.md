# Chess-web-scraping
This project is a web scraping project that scrapes the chess.com website for all the chess grandmasters in the world and stores the data in a csv file. The data includes the player's name, country, title year, and year of birth.

My objective with this data was to determine the oldest and the youngest individuals to achieve the title of grandmaster.
